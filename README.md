# Wildlife-Insights----Data-Migration
This repo will contain code that will assist current or future Wildlife Insights data providers to get their data into the format required to be uploaded into Wildlife Insights. 

Upload Format - [Batch Upload Template Data Dictionaries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PE5Zl-HUG4Zt0PwSfj-gJRJVbZ__LgH3VuiDW3-BKQg/edit#gid=807650760)

We should aim to have software migration to function with all the software programs mentioned in the [Young et al paper](https://github.com/ConservationInternational/Wildlife-Insights----Data-Migration/blob/master/Young%20et%20al%202018%20CT%20data%20mgmt%20review.pdf)

A directory with the Source Name will be created for each camera trap data source. Custom scripts for non-standardized data sources should be included in the Custom Sources Directory
