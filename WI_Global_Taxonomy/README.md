# WI Global Taxonomy

Use the R script WI_Taxonomy.R to download the most current version of the WI Taxonomy. We created the WI Taxonomy because we needed a global standard of what we call things (wildlife, objects, humans, etc) in every project, every image, every video (soon!) every acoustic file (soon!) that anyone could share from around the world. We leverage existing standards as best we can and will provide mappings into as many standards as possible. 

**Mammals** - The WI taxonomy	uses a combination of the [IUCN Red List of Endangered Species](https://www.iucnredlist.org) and the [American Society of Mammalogists Mammal Diversity Database](https://mammaldiversity.org/). 

**Birds** - We use [Birdlife International's taxonomy](http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/search).

**Everything else** - We have also have names for other taxa (reptiles,insects, etc). domestic species, non-animals (car, motorcycle,etc) and have various classes to describe types of humans (park ranger, tourist, etc). 


The WI taxonomy will continue to grow and evolve over time. If you have questions about the taxonomy please email us at info@wildlifeinsights.org.
