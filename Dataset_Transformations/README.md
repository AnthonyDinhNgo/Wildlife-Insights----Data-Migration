# Dataset Transformations
 Store your original datasets (whatever format you have) here and have the transformation script
 create the new batch upload files here as well. 

# The typical directory structure can be:
 ProjectName
  - Original Data Files Directory Name
	- one or more files	
  - Batch Upload Files Directory Name 
     	- The four files required for batch upload:
		- projects.csv
		- cameras.csv
		- deployments.csv
		- images.csv
